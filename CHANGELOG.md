# Dosmax Activity Log - Recent Fixes (August 14, 2025)

## Issues Resolved

### ✅ Pagination Fixed
**Problem**: Plugin was showing only 2 records instead of 100 per page
**Solution**: 
- Changed `per_page` from 25 to 100 in admin page class
- Fixed pagination count display to use filtered results
- Added proper parameter passing for total item counts

### ✅ "More Details" AJAX Fixed
**Problem**: "More details" functionality not working in WordPress environment
**Solution**:
- Updated JavaScript to use WordPress AJAX endpoints (`dosmax_ajax.ajax_url`)

- Corrected script localization with proper AJAX parameters
- Changed from demo handler `/ajax-handler.php` to WordPress `admin-ajax.php`

**Solution**:

- Replaced static demo data with dynamic database results
- Added proper date formatting using custom format functions
